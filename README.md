# pymmWave
Goals:
An easy to use mmWave library to get up and running within minutes.
Simple data interfacing, and complete type hinting.
Easy classes to implement for custom implementations.

This library is reliant on Python's asyncio package. User applications should interface with this tool with some sort of event loop manager.
Future support around this may be built.

TODO:
 - Pose estimation based on trajectory.
 - Perhaps continuous estimated state management.
